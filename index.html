        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Greetings! I'm an aspiring Mechanical Engineering student with a fervent passion for cutting-edge technologies in aerospace, renewable energy, and robotics.
           My journey in the realm of engineering has been nothing short of exhilarating, as I find myself constantly drawn to the limitless possibilities that these fields offer.
           I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow.
           I relish challenges, seeing them as opportunities to innovate and find elegant solutions.
           Through hands-on experiences, collaborative projects, and a thirst for knowledge, I'm eager to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of engineering.
           When I'm not immersed in the world of engineering you can find me exploring the latest breakthroughs in science and technology,
           or perhaps lost in a good book that delves into the mysteries of the universe.
           I also enjoy staying active, whether through outdoor adventures or honing my skills in various sports.
           I'm excited to be on this journey, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
           Together, let's push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of engineering and beyond! </p>

        <h3> Material Failure Test </h3>
        <p>
          This project entailed conducting a comprehensive stress test on a cantilever beam.
          Using precise instrumentation and analytical techniques, the beam's structural integrity was rigorously assessed under varying loads and conditions.
          The study encompassed the application of static and dynamic loads, with a focus on observing deformation, strain distribution, and stress concentrations.
          Advanced software tools were employed for data acquisition and analysis. The project provided valuable insights into material behavior and structural performance,
          with potential applications in optimizing beam designs for real-world engineering applications.
          The results contributed to enhancing the understanding of the relationship between material properties and their relative toughness.

        <h3> Controller Design for a DC Motor </h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to design a controller for a motor attached to the shaft of a flywheel.
          The model was described by a unique transfer function with
          moment of inertia, damping coefficient, and conversion factor from voltage to torque being held constant.
          The input voltage and its varying forms such as step and sinusodial were utilzied to test the response of the system.
          This experiment required deep understanding signals, systems, and controller design in order to get precise respones from the motor assembly.

        <h3> Item Sorting Machine </h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to contribute to the advancement of item sorting technology.
          This involved the creation of an advanced item sorting machine, leveraging a diverse skill set in various engineering diciplines.
          Through hand sketching and CAD proficiency (AutoCAD for 2D and AutoDesk for 3D), concepts were translated into precise virtual models.
          The use of Rapid prototyping, laser cutting, CNC machining, and 3D printing expidited the fabrication process. Furthermore, the efficiency of the machine was ensured by
          proficiency in shop tools, machine design principles, and physics-driven analysis.
          Effective teamwork, project management, and risk reduction strategies allowed for the project to be completed in seven weeks.
          Additionally, strong communication skills in both oral presentations and written reports was a pivotal role in conveying complex engineering concepts.

        <h3>Rocket Recovery Simulation</h3>
        <p> The objective of the project was to simulate the trajectories of a rocket as it descends
            onto a mountainous terrain. Along the trajectories, the motion of the rocket was assumably
            influenced by propulsion, air drag on the rocket body, gravity, wind advection, and the
            parachutes during recovery. Various launches were simulated and analyzed to examine how
            the deployment of the parachutes affected the flight dynamics. </p>

        <h3> Automated Teller Machine </h3>
        <p> Developed a program provided users with a user-friendly interface for conducting basic banking transactions in a
          secure and efficient manner. The program also gave the users to the ability to store entries,
          withdraw cash/deposit cash, fund transfers, and PIN-based security checks. The Program also gave the users the freedom
          to access any transactions through a "history" feature. Finally, the console allowed for transactions to be printed output
          in the form of a receipt. The entire project was utilizing C++ programming language and required deep understanding of pointers, functions, linked-lists,
          as well as object-based coding. </p>
